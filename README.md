# Rm2k PNG

Rm2k PNG is a library that converts any PNG file to an 8-bit RPG Maker 2000 / 2003 compatible PNG if less than 256 colors are used.

This library was created so that I could build the [rm2kfixwatcher](cmd/rm2kfixwatcher/README.md) tool, which allows users to work in paint tools they're comfortable in without needing to think about managing their palette manually (until they exceed the max 256 colors that is!).
