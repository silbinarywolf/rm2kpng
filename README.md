# Rm2k PNG

**WARNING: This is a work-in-progress in a branch and is not ready yet**

Rm2k PNG is a library that converts any PNG file to an 8-bit RPG Maker 2000 / 2003 compatible PNG if less than 256 colors are used.

This library was built so that I could build the `rm2kfixwatcher` tool, so that users can work in paint tools they're comfortable in without needing to think about managing their palette (until they exceed the max 256 colors that is!).

This repository also contains tools that aim to help users convert their PNGs to RPG Maker compatible PNGs.
