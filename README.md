# Rm2k PNG

**WARNING: This is a work-in-progress in a branch and is not ready yet**

Rm2k PNG is a library that converts any PNG file to an 8-bit RPG Maker 2000 / 2003 compatible PNG if less than 256 colors are used.

This library was built so that I could build the [rm2kfixwatcher](cmd/rm2kfixwatcher/README.md) tool, so that users can work in paint tools they're comfortable in without needing to think about managing their palette (until they exceed the max 256 colors that is!).
